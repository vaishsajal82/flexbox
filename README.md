# flexbox
This is a simple project where I learned and practiced CSS Flexbox.
I created a basic webpage using HTML and used Flexbox in CSS to arrange and organize elements properly on the page.
What this project includes:
A simple webpage structure using HTML
Flexbox properties in CSS for layout and alignment
Clean and easy-to-understand code
